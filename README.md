# LoLPerformance - What is it?
A tool which extracts data from your last LoL game and fills it in a performance Excel table.
It devides all of your queues in different sheets and adds some coloring depending on if a stat is good or bad.
Some stats (like kills or assists) are subjective so we don't touch those.

# WHY?
The primary reason is to have an easy way to check your progress. I've found that sites like [OP.GG](https://www.op.gg/?hl=en_US) or [League of graphs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/) don't summorize the data in a manner that I like so the project was born.
It provides very simple and obvious way to analyze progress over large number of games.

# Instal
