# LoLPerformance - What is it?
A tool which extracts data from your last LoL game and fills it in a performance Excel table.
It devides all of your queues in different sheets and adds some coloring depending on if a stat is good or bad.
Some stats (like kills or assists) are subjective so we don't touch those.

# Why should you use it?
The primary reason is to have an easy way to check your progress. I've found that sites like [OP.GG](https://www.op.gg/?hl=en_US) or [League of graphs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/) don't summorize the data in a manner that I like. It looks good and it gives you an overview of the last few games but you cannot see if you've improved over the season.
Viewing your progress in an excel spreadsheet sure feels weird (and ugly) compared to those sites but it serves a better purpose if your main goal is to improve. The main idea is taken from [Simba ADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnhBC9efvrU).
